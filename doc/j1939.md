# SAE-J1939 support

When the target DBC file and ECU follow the SAE-J1939 standard, the CAN reader application of the provider should read
PGN(Parameter Group Number)-based Data rather than CAN frames directly. Otherwise it is possible to miss signals from
large-sized messages that are delivered with more than one CAN frame because the size of each of these messages is bigger
than a CAN frame's maximum payload of 8 bytes. To enable the J1939 mode, simply put `--use-j1939` in the command when running `dbcfeeder.py`.

Support for J1939 is provided by means of the [can-j1939 package](https://pypi.org/project/can-j1939/).
The J1939 feature is in Alpha status (see [KUKSA Component Maturity ](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/wiki/KUKSA.val-Component-Maturity))
as no public test cases or example configurations exist.
